### GitHub Push Instructions

To push these changes to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Stage all changes:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

2. Commit the changes with a message:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Refactor library to class-based structure and update documentation"
    ```

3. Push the changes to the remote repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

Make sure to replace `"main"` with the correct branch name if your branch is named differently. This will update your GitHub repository with the refactored code and updated documentation.
